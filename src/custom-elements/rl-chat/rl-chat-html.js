                The examination will be done as an oral hearing where you get a couple of theoretical questions from this part (Lecture 1 to 10) and also show your practical assignment. You can´t book a time for oral hearing before you are ready with the assignment and have done a release on GitHub.

                You can choose between a campus or distance exam.
