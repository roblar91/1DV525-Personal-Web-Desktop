## Personal Web Desktop
This was a project in the course 1DV525 with the goal of producing a windows-like environment using web technology.


The app can be accessed via https://roblar91.github.io/1DV525-Personal-Web-Desktop/src/, although the quiz and chat apps will not work since they are reliant on servers provided by the school.
